CSCI-605 Homework 9: Connect Four

Answer each of the following questions regarding the design of this application.

1. In terms of MVC, which part does ConnectFourBoard represent?

The class ConnectFourBoard represents the model portion of the MVC architecture. This is the object
that we are manipulating through our PTUI and our GUI, whichever is loaded/ran.

2. In terms of MVC, which *parts* do ConnectFourGUI and ConnectFourPTUI represent?

The ConnectFourGUI and the ConnectFourPTUI represent the viewer and the controller for the MVC
architecture. These classes display a view of the board (the view portion) and allow for manipulation
of the game state through commands or buttons (the controller portion).

3. What interface/method must ConnectFourGUI implement?

ConnectFourGUI must implement the Observer<> interface and the singular method update(). This allows
the observers to ask the model what has happened/changed.

4. What method in ConnectFourBoard is used to call into ConnectFourGUI when the board changes?

The notifyObservers() method is used to call into the ConnectFourGUI when the board changes, and
has the GUI execute its update() method.
